![Calulator](/img/calculator.png)

**Description**: This is a simple calculator. 

##Features
* Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide

##Project Notes
  * The calculator was one of the more difficult projects I did. There are many aspects to 
    account for regarding the different ways in which tasks like adding should work, i.e. pushing 
    the plus button continuously after each number and calculate the total, as well as have the equal button
    do it as well.
  * **This calculator is still in development.**
